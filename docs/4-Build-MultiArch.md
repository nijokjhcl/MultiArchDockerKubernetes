# 4. Building your multi-arch images

This section goes through installing the manifest tool and building the multi-arch docker images.

## If Using Proxy
If using proxy, make sure you've read [0-ProxyPSA](0-ProxyPSA.md) and have set your http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy variables for your environment as specified there. Also note that for all docker run commands add the -e for each of the proxy environment variables as specified in that 0-ProxyPSA document.

## Enabling Docker Experimental Features
We need to enable experimental features for both the docker client and server in order to use the `docker manifest` command and `--platform` tags respectively. In order to do this please follow the steps below for your operating system.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE USE DOCKER 18.06 or later
If you don't have at least this version, please upgrade

![Upgrade Docker](../images/DockerUpdate.png)

Check with `docker version`

![Docker Version Output](../images/Docker_Version_Experimental_Check.PNG)

*Under Client:* If `Experimental: false` like in the above picture then you need to do the *Client* steps. If `Experimental: true` then you can skip the *Client* steps.

*Under Server:* If `Experimental: false` like in the above picture, you need to do the *Server* steps. If `Experimental: true` then you can skip the *Server* steps.

###### Linux
*Client*

`ls ~/.docker`

If `~/.docker/config.json` exists:

(Open config.json with your favorite text editor)

`vim ~/.docker/config.json`

Add `"experimental": "enabled"` to config.json file

![End Result](../images/Linux_add_experimental.png)

If `~/.docker/config.json` doesnâ€™t exist:

`mkdir .docker`

`echo $'{\n    "experimental": "enabled"\n}' | tee ~/.docker/config.json`

Add `"experimental": "enabled"` to `config.json` file

![Client Enabled Result](../images/Linux_add_client_fresh.png)

*Server*

`sudo ls /etc/docker`

If `/etc/docker/daemon.json` exists:

(Open daemon.json with your favorite text editor)

`sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json`
Add `"experimental": true` to `daemon.json` file

If `/etc/docker/daemon.json` doesn't exist:

`echo $'{\n    "experimental": true\n}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json`

![Server Enabled Result](../images/Linux_add_server_experimental.png)

*Restart Docker to Pick Up Changes*

`sudo service docker restart`

Once docker is started, check `docker version` again to see experimental set to true for both client and server.

![Docker Version Final Linux](../images/Docker_Version_Final_Mac.png)

###### Mac
Open the Preferences from the menu

![Open Settings](../images/open_preferences_docker_mac.png)

*Client*

Go to `Command Line` and click to Enable expermental features. Then, click `Apply and Restart`.

![Command Line Mac](../images/Command_Line_Mac.png)

*Server*

Go to `Docker Engine` and change false to true for experimental. Then, click`Apply & Restart`.

![Docker Engine Mac](../images/Docker_Engine_Mac.png)

Once docker is started check `docker version` again to see experimental set to true for both client and server.

![Docker Version Final Mac](../images/Docker_Version_Final_Mac.png)

###### Windows
In the Windows file explorer go to your users directory and see if `.docker` exists if so open that directory and edit it with your favorite text editor. Add `"experimental": "enabled"` to the `config.json` file

If it doesn't exist, make a new folder called `.docker` and create a new file called `config.json`. Add "experimental: enabled" inside of brackets.

![End Result](../images/Enabling-experimental.PNG)

###### Check for Success
In the end check your docker version to see that the change persisted. Specifically, look for client's experimental section being marked `Experimental: True`.

## Cross-Architecture Docker

Normally, one can only run docker images compiled for the host machine's architecture. This means that in order to run an s390x image, you would need an s390x server. Additionally, since building an s390x image in most cases requires running s390x binaries on your system, this also requires an s390x server. The same holds true for arm, x86 (amd64), power (ppc64le), etc. This limits the ability to build images that are available across all platforms. One way to overcome this limitation is by using [binfmt_misc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html) in conjunction with [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) (quick emulation) running using [User-mode-emulation](https://ownyourbits.com/2018/06/13/transparently-running-binaries-from-any-architecture-in-linux-with-qemu-and-binfmt_misc/). Qemu dynamically translates the target architecture's instructions to the the host architecture's instruction set to enable binaries of a different architecture to run on a host system. [Binfmt_misc](https://lwn.net/Articles/679308/) comes in to enable the kernel to read the foreign architecture binary by ["directing"](https://lwn.net/Articles/679308/) the kernel to the correct qemu static binary to interpret the code.

In order to set this up to work with Docker and its underlying linux kernel, we first need:

1. binfmt_misc to register the corresponding qemu-static binary for each architecture that has a static qemu image available [of course other than the native one; s390x in this case].

2. provide these qemu-static binaries to the system for the host architecture to all of the target architectures. *You can get these by building them from the qemu code or from a package of qemu for your os*

3. load the static immediately so it is in place to be used with Docker for each container it creates in their new sets of namespaces [read: use `F flag` for binfmt_misc setup]

We are able to achieve these 3 things by using the [docker/binfmt](https://github.com/docker/binfmt) github project.

The implementation they have works for an amd64 host so I have made a separate image with the qemu-static binaries compiled from the s390x host and posted that multi-arch image to `gmoney23/binfmt`

You can test this out by first running an image that is from a different platform than yours.

##### Linux
`docker pull --platform amd64 hello-world`

`docker run hello-world`

You should get an exec format error like so:
![Failure exec error](../images/exec_error_amd64_s390x.png)

Now, run the docker image to perform the aforementioned required 3 steps on either s390x of amd64:

`docker run --rm --privileged gmoney23/binfmt`

`--privileged` gives the container the necessary permissions it requires. The script within this container registers qemu `linux-user` binaries with binfmt_misc. (These binaries are statically compiled on the host architecture for each supported target architecture. In our case: s390x, arm, and ppc64le on amd64 and arm, amd64, and ppc64le on s390x). These binaries are generated during container build and are found within the `gmoney23/binfmt:3.10` container. They are registered with the [F (fixed) flag](https://lwn.net/Articles/679308/) which opens the static binary as soon as it is installed so that spawned containers can use the qemu static. This support was added to the linux kernel to enable things such as the cross-building we are going to do. (The full options are `OCF` and you can see the full description for each option [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.rst))

Confirm the architecture with: `uname -m`

Confirm the image architecture with: `docker inspect -f '{{.Architecture}}' hello-world`

Finally, run the image successfully with the same command as before: `docker run hello-world`

![Run amd64 with qemu](../images/qemu_s390x_run_amd64.png)

We can also see in the `hello-world` output the `amd64` architecture mentioned as achieved our goal of running amd64 (x86) images on `s390x`.

##### Mac / Windows
Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows have this capability built-in out of the box so we don't even have to set it up with an image run. We can see this trying the `s390x` (z) image for `hello-world` on our `amd64` (x86) mac:

`docker pull --platform s390x hello-world`

Confirm the architecture with: `uname -m`

Confirm the image architecture with: `docker inspect -f '{{.Architecture}}' hello-world`

Finally, run the image successfully with the same command as before: `docker run hello-world`

![Run s390x with qemu](../images/qemu_mac_s390x_hello-world.png)

This works successfully (without additional configuration needed) 

**What do you mean by this capability is built-in out of the box?**
Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows runs containers in a vm (either a hypervisor of hyperkit on mac [a derivative of xhyve] or hyper-v on windows) which it uses to run a linux kernel that in this case is set up with binfmt_misc which is used to emulate the other architectures by setting up a file system with a static arch interpreter (a qemu linux-user static file for the given arch). The set up we are doing is already done by this as part of the setup for that environment. Meanwhile, since we already have a linux kernel with docker for linux, we get the privilege of making our own changes to it for now. If this brief talk about Docker for Mac internals piqued your interest, I highly encourage [Under the Hood: Demystifying Docker For Mac CE Edition](http://collabnix.com/how-docker-for-mac-works-under-the-hood/)

The ease of running and building multi-arch on mac and windows fills us with determination ...

### Consequences of Cross-Architecture Docker

This enables us to not only run images, but also build them for different architectures from a given host architecture. This makes it possible to build s390x (z), power (ppc64le), arm, and amd64 images all from the hosts you have available. This enables developers to support more images as they may have nodes with only specific architectures such as `amd64`. Using this technology, suddenly the ecosystem that can contribute is no longer constrained by this limitation, creating broader ecosystem for everyone. In fact, with the current stable docker CE build and onward  [buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx) comes as an experimental future to build and push multi-arch images (using qemu behind the scenes) in a seamless process which we will explore after the traditional method below. The one caveat to all of this capability is that qemu does not support all instructions and is being constantly improved to handle more exceptions and work for more use cases in the future. What is supported will be dictated by which linux-user static binary you are using with arm and s390x have more support than ppc64le at the current time. This means for certain image builds you will still have to use the native hardware but for many images qemu provides a quick and easy way to build images for more platforms. 

Next, we will use an amd64 host to build images for both architectures and use them to make multi-arch images that support both architectures for each of the applications we have visited in parts 2 and 3 of this tutorial.

*Note: amd64 linux-user does not have the capability required for these images at this time (i.e. running npm install) which is why the host needs to be amd64 if we want to include an amd64 image. This is largely in part to lack of need to emulate amd64 due to its wide availability and most personal workstations using amd64 architecture.*

## Making multi-arch docker images

In order to build all of the images for both amd64 (x86) and s390x (z) architectures, we will use a simple script that I wrote to go through the steps of building each individual architecture image with both a versioned and latest tag. Then, it creates a manifest list for each application and pushes it up to form a multiarch image for each of the applications we have gone over. It is heavily commented so it should explain itself.

![Build and Push Images Script Overview](../images/build_and_push_script.png)

If you want to visit the script itself you can open in it a new tab by right-clicking on: 

[Build and Push Images Script](../Build_And_Push_Images.sh)

### Login to your Dockerhub Account

`docker login`

Enter your username and password when prompted:

![Docker Login Before Script](../images/docker_login_before_script.png)

### Run Script to build and Push Images

#### Without Proxy

The options are as follows:

`DOCKER_REPO=<my_docker_repo> VERSION=<version_number> IMAGE_PREPEND=<prepend_to_make_unique_image> LATEST=<true_or_false> ./Build_And_Push_Images.sh`

Sample Command with my docker repo of `gmoney23` please replace with your docker repo:

`DOCKER_REPO=gmoney23 VERSION=1.0 IMAGE_PREPEND=marchdockerlab LATEST=true ./Build_And_Push_Images.sh`

#### With Proxy

The options are as follows:

`DOCKER_REPO=<my_docker_repo> VERSION=<version_number> IMAGE_PREPEND=<prepend_to_make_unique_image> LATEST=<true_or_false> http_proxy=<proxy_for_http_protocol> https_proxy=<proxy_for_https_protocol> no_proxy=<addresses_not_to_be_proxied> ./Build_And_Push_Images.sh`

Sample Command with my docker repo of `gmoney23` please replace with your docker repo:

`DOCKER_REPO=gmoney23 VERSION=1.0 IMAGE_PREPEND=marchdockerlab LATEST=true http_proxy=http://myproxy:8080 https_proxy=http://myproxy:8080 no_proxy="localhost, 127.0.0.1" ./Build_And_Push_Images.sh`

## Buildx: Seamless multi-arch builds are in your future

Buildx [https://github.com/docker/buildx] has become a part of stable Docker builds with `Docker CE 19.03` as an experimental feature. 

Since we have already enabled experimental features if our docker version is 19.03 or greater, we are ready to use buildx. We have already built are images above using a script. Let's see what the future holds...

First, we will create a new builder:
```
 docker buildx create --name multi-arch
```
Next, we will set this to our active builder:
```
docker buildx use multi-arch
```
Then, we will bootstrap it. At this point it will look for the supported architectures on our system using qemu and list them for us.
```
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```
Finally, we can see our current builders with
```
docker buildx ls
```

Here is how this all looks from my mac:

![Buildx Mac Setup](../images/buildx_setup.png)

Notice, that the 2 architectures we want to use (s390x and amd64) are both supported on my system. This is because the qemu emulation is set up for s390x, arm (multiple versions), and ppc64le and my host platform is amd64 (in this case). This will work on any machine once its set up: either out-of-the-box with docker desktop for mac or windows or after you enable qemu on your linux box like we did above with the `gmoney23/binfmt` image.

Now, we can create a multi-architecture image for the two architectures (and more if desired) in one command
```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/s390x -t gmoney23/buildx-hello-node:1.0 node-web-app --push
```
![Buildx Hello](../images/buildx-build-hello-node.png)

We can look at our newly pushed image to verify with:

```
docker run mplatform/mquery gmoney23/buildx-hello-node:1.0`
```
![mplatform buildx hello node](../images/mplatform-buildx-hello-node.png)

To see the full manifest list we can inspect it with
```
docker manifest inspect gmoney23/buildx-hello-node:1.0
```

![manifest buildx hello node](../images/manifest-buildx-hello-node.png)

Buildx isn't just limited to multi-arch builds with statics, it can also register remote builders to build images on those machines. Again, if you want to check it out see the [buildx github](https://github.com/docker/buildx). Also, if you want to see a walkthrough on buildx with arm see [Building Multi-Arch Images for Arm and x86 with Docker Desktop](https://engineering.docker.com/2019/04/multi-arch-images/).

We can use buildx to simplify the multi-arch process even further by bringing our build pipeline together in one place and allowing us to concurrently construct images for all arches that we can use in our manifest lists to "create" multi-arch images in one command.

Now, it's time to use the multi-arch images in Kubernetes!

Hearing `Kubernetes` fills us with determination...
### [Part 5: Now, it's time to get these images into Kubernetes](5-Deploy-to-Kubernetes.md)

**Below is a Manual collection of tasks to build images in more depth if you want more detail. This is purely for educational purposes if something in the script didn't make sense or you want further material and not part of the main path to follow the main path click to go to [part 5](5-Deploy-to-Kubernetes.md)**

#### OPTIONAL [Most Users Should Skip]: Overview of Process the Manual Way Building on Separate Machines

### 1.	Build image for all architectures and push to docker registry.
First is the list of basic steps, then a pattern you can use with both the mac and command  prompt commands.

#### Basic Steps
  a. Build and push image for s390x (Go onto an s390x linux instance, ssh in)

    i. Get your code onto the instance (i.e. download git files onto the machine or git clone https://github.com/siler23/MultiArchMultiArchDockerICP.git)

    ii. Get to the directory with the code (cd MultiArchDockerICP)

    iii. Build the image using docker (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-s390x .)

    PROXY: add build args for PROXY using previously set variables or if not reset variables and then run (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg no_proxy="$no_proxy" .)

    iv. Docker login to your docker registry (docker login registry_address) [only need to do once for each command prompt/terminal session on a machine]

    v. Docker push image (docker push myrepo/outyet-s390x)

  b. Build and push image for x86 (Go onto an x86 computer with docker, probably your workstation)

    i. Get your code onto the instance if not already there (i.e. git clone https://github.com/siler23/MultiArchDockerICP.git)

    ii. Get to the directory with the code and Dockerfile (cd MultiArchDockerICP)

    iii. Build the image using docker (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 .)

    PROXY: add build args for PROXY using previously set variables or if not reset variables and then run (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 --build-arg http_proxy=%http_proxy% --build-arg https_proxy=%https_proxy% --build-arg no_proxy="%no_proxy%" .)

    iv. Docker login to your docker registry (docker login registry_address)

    v. Docker push image (docker push myrepo/outyet-x86)

## 2.	Make manifest list
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***

Make a manifest list (a multi-architecture image reference) out of that individual images your pushed. Basically, you are mapping both images to the same tag so that when someone asks for the image via `docker pull gmoney23/outyet` it will have a pointer to the correct image for your architecture automatically (i.e. if you are on s390x it will point to layers from gmoney23/outyet-s390x or if you are on x86 it will point to layers from gmoney23/outyet-x86) while using the same label (i.e. gmoney23/outyet). This makes it so users of the image donâ€™t have to worry about using different tags for different archs so the Dockerfiles can be the same for different applications across architectures (i.e. the same Dockerfile can be used for a node application on z and x86 or a go application on z and x86).

## Docker Manifest: An experimental feature

### Recommended Option: Unless need added features, use this built-in command and skip the optional section. If need added features, do the OPTIONAL section marked OPTIONAL below.
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***
### Enabling manifest lists in Docker
docker manifest
docker manifest is only supported on a Docker cli with experimental cli features enabled

First `docker login` to your registry

IF USING PROXY: make sure your http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy our set ***if pushing to a repo outside of your internal network***.
#### Push versioned first

**Replace gmoney23 with your registry in the commands below**

`docker manifest create gmoney23/outyet:1.0 gmoney23/outyet-s390x:1.0 gmoney23/outyet-x86:1.0`

`docker manifest push -p gmoney23/outyet:1.0` (It takes a minute to push, be patient)

If you want to inspect your manifest, use `docker manifest inspect gmoney23/outyet:1.0`
#### Then push latest for current versioned

**Replace gmoney23 with your registry in the commands below**

`docker manifest create gmoney23/outyet gmoney23/outyet-s390x gmoney23/outyet-x86`

`docker manifest push -p gmoney23/outyet` (It takes a minute to push, be patient)
**-p is important so you can push new manifests later for latest tag (no version tag defaults to latest as in this example)**

If you want to inspect your manifest, use `docker manifest inspect gmoney23/outyet`

**But what if I already pushed a latest before and want to update it with my new latest version?**

For example, you just pushed version 2.0 of your app, you can update the existing manifest by using:

 `docker manifest create --amend gmoney23/outyet gmoney23/outyet-s390x gmoney23/outyet-x86`

  to replace the new latest manifest with the old one after you have already updated the latest individual images to the version 2.0 images.


***You can also make a pattern for all of this if you want to automate the process or just type it out for each image...***

Time to go to the last stage, unless you need that pesky manifest-tool.

### [Part 5: Now, it's time to get these images into Kubernetes](5-Deploy-to-Kubernetes.md)

#### OPTIONAL [Most Users Should Skip]: Install Manifest tool if need added features
The docker manifest command is experimental becuase while it does create manifests and push it doesn't have other features yet such as pushing manifest from files. If you want these extra features you can install the manifest tool here. If not, I would suggest just using the docker manifest command as its generally integrated better with docker. For example, once you docker login you don't need to enter username/password like you do with manifest-tool.

***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***

If golang not yet installed, install here with package for your os/arch [here](https://golang.org/dl/)

If git not yet installed, see instructions here for how to install for your os [Git install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

***If using proxy***, set git proxy settings. An example would be if you want to use proxy for all git push/pull set `git config --global http.proxy http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port
` replacing with your proxy values. For more different git proxy configurations for your specific needs so [this gist on using git with proxies](https://gist.github.com/evantoli/f8c23a37eb3558ab8765)

Install manifest-tool here with package for your os/arch [here](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool/releases)

#### After all s390x and amd64 images are pushed (Only do the do following if you haven't done with the docker manifest command)
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***
##### Push versioned manifest first
First, you will update the yaml files in the given directory of the image you are trying to push (in this case outyet) as well as change into the directory. Then, switch my username/password in the following command for yours for the image repository you are pushing to and:

IF USING PROXY: make sure your http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy are set if pushing to a repo outside of your internal network.

`manifest-tool --username gmoney23 --password *** push from-spec smallest-outyet/vmanifest.yaml`

##### Then push latest manifest for current versioned
`manifest-tool --username gmoney23 --password *** push from-spec smallest-outyet/manifest.yaml`


##### [Part 5: Now, it's time to get these images into Kubernetes](5-Deploy-to-Kubernetes.md)
