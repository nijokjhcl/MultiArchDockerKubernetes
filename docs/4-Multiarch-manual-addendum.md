**Below is a Manual collection of tasks to build images in more depth if you want more detail. This is purely for educational purposes if something in the script didn't make sense or you want further material and not part of the main path to follow the main path click to go to [part 5](5-Deploy-to-Kubernetes.md)**

### 1.	Build image for all architectures and push to docker registry.
First is the list of basic steps, then a pattern you can use with both the mac and command  prompt commands.

#### Basic Steps
  a. Build and push image for s390x (Go onto an s390x linux instance, ssh in)

    i. Get your code onto the instance (i.e. download git files onto the machine or git clone https://github.com/siler23/MultiArchMultiArchDockerICP.git)

    ii. Get to the directory with the code (cd MultiArchDockerICP)

    iii. Build the image using docker (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-s390x .)

    PROXY: add build args for PROXY using previously set variables or if not reset variables and then run (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg no_proxy="$no_proxy" .)

    iv. Docker login to your docker registry (docker login registry_address) [only need to do once for each command prompt/terminal session on a machine]

    v. Docker push image (docker push myrepo/outyet-s390x)

  b. Build and push image for x86 (Go onto an x86 computer with docker, probably your workstation)

    i. Get your code onto the instance if not already there (i.e. git clone https://github.com/siler23/MultiArchDockerICP.git)

    ii. Get to the directory with the code and Dockerfile (cd MultiArchDockerICP)

    iii. Build the image using docker (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 .)

    PROXY: add build args for PROXY using previously set variables or if not reset variables and then run (docker build -t myrepo/outyet-x86 --build-arg http_proxy=%http_proxy% --build-arg https_proxy=%https_proxy% --build-arg no_proxy="%no_proxy%" .)

    iv. Docker login to your docker registry (docker login registry_address)

    v. Docker push image (docker push myrepo/outyet-x86)

### 2.	Make manifest list
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***

Make a manifest list (a multi-architecture image reference) out of that individual images your pushed. Basically, you are mapping both images to the same tag so that when someone asks for the image via `docker pull gmoney23/outyet` it will have a pointer to the correct image for your architecture automatically (i.e. if you are on s390x it will point to layers from gmoney23/outyet-s390x or if you are on x86 it will point to layers from gmoney23/outyet-x86) while using the same label (i.e. gmoney23/outyet). This makes it so users of the image donâ€™t have to worry about using different tags for different archs so the Dockerfiles can be the same for different applications across architectures (i.e. the same Dockerfile can be used for a node application on z and x86 or a go application on z and x86).

### Docker Manifest: An experimental feature

#### Recommended Option: Unless need added features, use this built-in command and skip the optional section. If need added features, do the OPTIONAL section marked OPTIONAL below.
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***
### Enabling manifest lists in Docker
docker manifest
docker manifest is only supported on a Docker cli with experimental cli features enabled

First `docker login` to your registry

IF USING PROXY: make sure your http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy our set ***if pushing to a repo outside of your internal network***.
#### Push versioned first

**Replace gmoney23 with your registry in the commands below**

`docker manifest create gmoney23/outyet:1.0 gmoney23/outyet-s390x:1.0 gmoney23/outyet-x86:1.0`

`docker manifest push -p gmoney23/outyet:1.0` (It takes a minute to push, be patient)

If you want to inspect your manifest, use `docker manifest inspect gmoney23/outyet:1.0`
#### Then push latest for current versioned

**Replace gmoney23 with your registry in the commands below**

`docker manifest create gmoney23/outyet gmoney23/outyet-s390x gmoney23/outyet-x86`

`docker manifest push -p gmoney23/outyet` (It takes a minute to push, be patient)
**-p is important so you can push new manifests later for latest tag (no version tag defaults to latest as in this example)**

If you want to inspect your manifest, use `docker manifest inspect gmoney23/outyet`

**But what if I already pushed a latest before and want to update it with my new latest version?**

For example, you just pushed version 2.0 of your app, you can update the existing manifest by using:

 `docker manifest create --amend gmoney23/outyet gmoney23/outyet-s390x gmoney23/outyet-x86`

  to replace the new latest manifest with the old one after you have already updated the latest individual images to the version 2.0 images.


***You can also make a pattern for all of this if you want to automate the process or just type it out for each image...***

Time to go to the last stage, unless you need that pesky manifest-tool.

### OPTIONAL [Most Users Should Skip]: Install Manifest tool if need added features
The docker manifest command is experimental because while it does create manifests and push it doesn't have other features yet such as pushing manifest from files. If you want these extra features you can install the manifest tool here. If not, I would suggest just using the docker manifest command as its generally integrated better with docker. For example, once you docker login you don't need to enter username/password like you do with manifest-tool.

***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***

If golang not yet installed, install here with package for your os/arch [here](https://golang.org/dl/)

If git not yet installed, see instructions here for how to install for your os [Git install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

***If using proxy***, set git proxy settings. An example would be if you want to use proxy for all git push/pull set `git config --global http.proxy http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port
` replacing with your proxy values. For more different git proxy configurations for your specific needs so [this gist on using git with proxies](https://gist.github.com/evantoli/f8c23a37eb3558ab8765)

Install manifest-tool here with package for your os/arch [here](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool/releases)

#### After all s390x and amd64 images are pushed (Only do the do following if you haven't done with the docker manifest command)
***You only need to do this from one computer which for ease of access should probably be your workstation computer rather than a server***
##### Push versioned manifest first
First, you will update the yaml files in the given directory of the image you are trying to push (in this case outyet) as well as change into the directory. Then, switch my username/password in the following command for yours for the image repository you are pushing to and:

IF USING PROXY: make sure your http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy are set if pushing to a repo outside of your internal network.

`manifest-tool --username gmoney23 --password *** push from-spec smallest-outyet/vmanifest.yaml`

##### Then push latest manifest for current versioned
`manifest-tool --username gmoney23 --password *** push from-spec smallest-outyet/manifest.yaml`
