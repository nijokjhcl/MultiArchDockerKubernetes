# From Docker to Kubernetes - Multi-Arch with Go and Nodejs

## Prerequisites
* Have an up and running Kubernetes cluster
* Setup access to that cluster using kubectl
* Download docker on your workstation

This guide will start by looking at what Official Repositories are and how to build from them. Then, it will shine light on how to tell if an app will run on your platform (architecture). Next, we will look at how best to build images for go and nodejs in docker with examples and then actually build these images with Multi-Architecture manifests. Finally, we will use these images or my pre-build images to deploy to a kubernetes cluster.
